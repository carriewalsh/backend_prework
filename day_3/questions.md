1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
In ruby, an if-statement begins with if and must have "end" written at the end.

In order to have multiple conditions, && || and ! can be used. If two things need to be true, && requires both have a value of true in order to have a value of true.

Like an if-statement, it needs if and "end", but this must include an elsif statement and an else statement. For humans to read, indents are included.
